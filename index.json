As organizations innovate and build trust with their customers, they must meet critical compliance requirements and strengthen data protection.\nHow and Why Encryption Works Encryption uses an algorithm and a key to transform readable data into ciphertext — which can only be decrypted using the correct key.\nExample:\nHello World! → 1c28df2b595b4e30b7b07500963dc7c\nStrong encryption systems rely on mathematical properties that make ciphertext computationally infeasible to break without the correct key.\nTherefore, protecting and managing encryption keys is central to every secure encryption solution.\nEncryption as Part of Your Security Strategy AWS uses the shared responsibility model.\nYou control access to your data, while AWS secures the underlying infrastructure.\nEncryption helps minimize risks such as:\nExcessive or misconfigured access Data exposure during transmission Unauthorized access at rest How secure is AES-256? AWS uses AES-256, a government-approved and industry-standard symmetric encryption algorithm.\nEven with future quantum computers, breaking AES-256 remains computationally infeasible.\nRequirements for an Effective Encryption Solution 1. Protecting Keys at Rest A strong encryption solution must ensure that:\nKeys never exist in plaintext outside a protected boundary Algorithms are implemented correctly and securely AWS uses HSMs (Hardware Security Modules) with:\nTamper detection and tamper response FIPS 140-2/140-3 Level 3 validation Two AWS HSM-based services: Service Description AWS KMS AWS manages HSM clusters for you AWS CloudHSM You manage your own HSMs Both support:\nCreating keys Importing keys from on-premises systems Direct encryption or envelope encryption Envelope Encryption A data encryption key (DEK) encrypts your data →\nDEK is then encrypted using a master key stored in HSM →\nImproves performance and reduces load on HSMs.\n2. Independent Key Management You must separate:\nKey administrators Data access administrators AWS KMS provides:\nFine-grained IAM policy control Key usage tracking via CloudTrail AWS CloudHSM provides fully independent key access policies.\nExternal Key Store (XKS) Since 2022, AWS KMS allows customers to store KMS keys in their own HSMs (on-premises or chosen locations).\nKMS proxies encryption/decryption requests to your HSM.\nThe key material never leaves your HSM.\nHowever, you become responsible for:\nDurability Availability Latency Throughput Losing the key means permanent loss of data.\nMonitoring and Auditing AWS KMS → CloudTrail: logs all key usage AWS CloudHSM → CloudWatch: streams audit events Encrypting Data at Rest and In Transit At Rest AWS services use AES-256 with master keys protected in HSMs.\nIn Transit AWS uses TLS 1.2 or higher, with TLS 1.3 recommended.\ns2n-tls Due to limitations in OpenSSL, AWS created s2n-tls:\nLightweight Easier to audit Verified using formal methods Open-source (Apache 2.0) s2n-quic and HTTP/3 AWS built s2n-quic in Rust to support QUIC — the foundation of HTTP/3.\nAmazon CloudFront supports HTTP/3 using s2n-quic.\nCertificate Management AWS simplifies issuing and rotating certificates via:\nAWS Certificate Manager (ACM) AWS Private CA Keys used for certificates are protected via KMS or CloudHSM.\nCryptographic Computing (Encrypting Data in Use) Used for:\nFederated machine learning Multi-party computation AWS Clean Rooms with C3R (Cryptographic Computing for Clean Rooms) enables data collaboration while keeping all data encrypted.\nQuantum Computing and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Quantum computers may break:\nRSA ECC Diffie–Hellman But AES-256 remains secure.\nAWS Adoption of PQC AWS has integrated ML-KEM, a NIST-selected PQC algorithm, into:\nAWS-LC (FIPS 140-3 validated library) s2n-tls AWS KMS AWS Certificate Manager AWS Secrets Manager AWS Transfer Family supports post-quantum hybrid SFTP.\nEncrypt Everything, Everywhere AWS enables encryption:\nAt rest In transit In memory Examples:\nS3 encrypts new objects by default EBS uses envelope encryption Graviton2/3 processors use always-on memory encryption As part of the AWS Digital Sovereignty Pledge, AWS continues investing in advanced encryption controls.\nConclusion At AWS, security is the top priority.\nAWS helps customers control how data is encrypted, managed, and protected across their entire infrastructure.\nAWS provides:\nStrong encryption technologies Scalable key management Compliance-ready security controls If you have questions, start a thread in the AWS KMS or AWS CloudHSM forums, or contact AWS Support.\nAuthors Ken Beer – Director of AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) and AWS Cryptography Libraries.\nHe has more than seven years of experience at AWS in identity and access management, encryption, and key management.\nBefore joining AWS, he led network security at Trend Micro and previously worked at Tumbleweed Communications.\nHe has presented at RSA Conference, the U.S. DoD PKI User’s Forum, and AWS re:Invent.\nZach Miller – Principal Security Specialist Solutions Architect at AWS.\nHe specializes in data protection, security architecture, applied cryptography, and secrets management.\nHe works with AWS enterprise customers to help them strengthen security posture and reduce operational risk.\n"},{"uri":"https://tranhoangtrunghieu.github.io/fcj-workshop-template-main/5-workshop/5.3-s3-vpc/5.3.1-create-gwe/","title":"Create a gateway endpoint","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Open the Amazon VPC console In the navigation pane, choose Endpoints, then click Create Endpoint: You will see 6 existing VPC endpoints that support AWS Systems Manager (SSM).

AWS encourages its customers to:\nUse cybersecurity standards and AWS architectural best practices. Implement a multi-account environment. Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to deploy environments and workloads. Prepare a recovery account in a separate Availability Zone (AZ) or Region. Store application code, IaC templates, configuration files, and dependencies in the recovery account. Build a backup strategy that replicates data to the recovery account. Implement automated unit and full workload testing within the recovery account. Use a Recognized Cybersecurity Framework As cybersecurity threats such as ransomware continue to increase, public sector organizations are turning to frameworks like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 for guidance on managing cybersecurity risks.\nAlthough CSF organizes cybersecurity outcomes into six functions:\nGovern Identify Protect Detect Respond Recover …it does not prescribe how these outcomes must be achieved.\nTo provide more concrete guidance:\nThe AWS Blueprint for Ransomware Defense maps specific AWS services to the CSF functions. The AWS Well-Architected Framework outlines six pillars to help architects build secure, reliable, high-performing, and efficient workloads, aligned with the AWS Shared Responsibility Model. The AWS Security Reference Architecture (AWS SRA) supplements these frameworks by helping organizations design and operate AWS security services according to AWS best practices. By combining NIST CSF and the Well-Architected Framework, this article explores essential patterns to prepare organizations for recovery from cybersecurity or disaster events.\nImplement a Multi-Account Strategy on AWS AWS recommends adopting a multi-account strategy—a best practice for building a scalable, controlled cloud environment (landing zone).\nKey enabling tools:\nAWS Organizations AWS Control Tower Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS Benefits of a multi-account strategy include:\nStronger workload and data isolation Reduced risk of unintended lateral movement Simplified automation and governance at scale AWS also recommends centrally managing user identities using AWS IAM Identity Center. External identity providers can be integrated, but during recovery situations you may need to use root credentials—although AWS strongly advises limiting root access to essential tasks only.\nRecently, AWS introduced centralized root credential management, improving overall security posture by eliminating long-lived credentials and preventing unauthorized recovery actions.\nBuild Your AWS Infrastructure with Automation (IaC) AWS recommends deploying all infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC)—a core DevSecOps principle.\nBenefits of IaC:\nFaster infrastructure replication Increased consistency and reproducibility Fewer configuration errors Built-in version control Faster recovery operations AWS provides multiple IaC options:\nAWS CloudFormation AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) Terraform (third-party, multi-cloud support) IaC should be parameterized using:\nResource names AWS Regions IP ranges Other environment-specific values → enabling reuse across accounts and Regions.\nIaC code should be stored in a source code repository (e.g., GitLab).\nOrganizations can adopt automated pipelines using AWS Prescriptive Guidance DevOps Pipeline Accelerator (DPA).\nPrepare a Recovery Location AWS recommends creating dedicated recovery accounts to protect against cybersecurity incidents such as identity compromise.\nRisk scenario:\nIf an attacker gains root access or escalates privileges in the primary account, backups stored in that same account could also be compromised.\nRecovery Within the Same Region (AZ Recovery) If recovering within the same Region:\nChoose an Availability Zone that is completely isolated. Maintain consistent Availability Zone IDs (AZ IDs) across all accounts. AWS assigns different AZ names per account, so AZ IDs must be used to ensure the recovery AZ never overlaps with deployment AZs.\nMulti-Region Recovery For resilience against large-scale disasters:\nUse multi-Region recovery, such as primary workloads in us-east-1 and recovery in us-east-2. At minimum, AWS recommends backing up data to another Region. Cross-Region backup may require revisiting your AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key strategy to ensure encrypted data can be decrypted in the recovery account and Region.\nNote: Inter-Region data transfer costs are higher than inter-AZ transfers.\nBuild a Backup Strategy and Implement Automated Testing AWS recommends designing a cloud-aligned backup strategy. After preparing the recovery location, organizations can use AWS Backup to store workload data in the recovery account.\nAWS Backup can also store:\nIaC templates Infrastructure configuration data Application code Application configuration files To ensure backup integrity, AWS recommends:\nAutomated testing and validation Verifying that backup data can be read Retaining multiple versions to mitigate ransomware risks Using AWS Backup Vault Lock to prevent unauthorized modifications Recovery workflows should include backups of every component required to rebuild workloads:\nIaC Infrastructure configuration AMIs Application code Application settings Testing should occur on a recurring basis. Organizations should periodically rebuild the entire workload in the recovery account using the stored backups and IaC templates.\nExisting component, integration, or user-acceptance testing scripts can be reused for these business continuity exercises.\nConclusion By following the best practices described in this article, public sector organizations can leverage AWS capabilities to prepare for and recover from business continuity events.\nFor additional guidance, contact your AWS account team or solutions architect.\nAuthors Devin Gordon Principal Solutions Architect at AWS, supporting U.S. federal civilian agencies.\nSpecializes in AWS security and enjoys helping customers deploy secure environments.\nInterests: travel, SCUBA diving, hiking, outdoor activities.\nHenrik Balle Principal Solutions Architect at AWS supporting the U.S. Public Sector.\nWorks with customers on machine learning, security, and governance at scale.\nInterests: long-distance road biking, motorcycling, and home improvement projects.\n"},{"uri":"https://tranhoangtrunghieu.github.io/fcj-workshop-template-main/5-workshop/5.4-s3-onprem/5.4.3-test-endpoint/","title":"Test the Interface Endpoint","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Get the regional DNS name of S3 interface endpoint From the Amazon VPC menu, choose Endpoints.\nClick the name of newly created endpoint: s3-interface-endpoint.

The Interface endpoint will allow you to route to Amazon S3 over a VPN connection from your simulated on-premises environment.\nWhy using Interface endpoint:\nGateway endpoints only work with resources running in the VPC where they are created. Interface endpoints work with resources running in VPC, and also resources running in on-premises environments. Connectivty from your on-premises environment to the cloud can be provided by AWS Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Interface endpoints allow you to connect to services powered by AWS PrivateLink. These services include some AWS services, services hosted by other AWS customers and partners in their own VPCs (referred to as PrivateLink Endpoint Services), and supported AWS Marketplace Partner services. For this workshop, we will focus on connecting to Amazon S3.

These approaches help optimize performance, resource usage, and resiliency when integrating generative AI into your serverless architectures.\nOverview of Serverless, LLMs, and the Example Scenario Organizations of all sizes are now leveraging LLMs to build next-generation generative AI applications that unlock new customer experiences.\nServerless technologies such as:\nAWS Lambda AWS Step Functions Amazon API Gateway …enable teams to go from idea to production quickly, without needing to manage servers. The pay-for-use billing model also supports flexible scaling with optimized cost.\nThe examples in this article use Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service that provides access to foundation models (FMs) via API. Similar principles apply when using LLMs hosted with other services such as Amazon SageMaker.\nThe example scenario illustrates using an LLM to generate engaging marketing content for launching a new family SUV model. Images used in the marketing content were generated using Amazon Titan Image Generator, as shown below.\nDirect Invocation from AWS Lambda Calling Amazon Bedrock directly from Lambda The simplest serverless integration pattern is invoking Bedrock directly from a Lambda function using the AWS SDK.\nBelow is a Python example using boto3 to call the InvokeModel operation:\nimport json import boto3 brt = boto3.client(service_name=\u0026#39;bedrock-runtime\u0026#39;) def lambda_handler(event, context): body = json.dumps({ \u0026#34;anthropic_version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;bedrock-2023-05-31\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;max_tokens\u0026#34;: 1000, \u0026#34;messages\u0026#34;: [{ \u0026#34;role\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;content\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Create a 500 word car advert given these images and the following specification: \\n {}\u0026#34;.format(event[\u0026#39;spec\u0026#39;]) }, { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;image\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;source\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;base64\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;media_type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;image/jpeg\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: event[\u0026#39;image\u0026#39;] } } ] }] }) modelId = \u0026#34;anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0\u0026#34; response = brt.invoke_model( body=body, modelId=modelId, accept=\u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34;, contentType=\u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34; ) response_body = json.loads(response.get(\u0026#34;body\u0026#34;).read()) return { \u0026#34;statusCode\u0026#34;: 200, \u0026#34;body\u0026#34;: response_body[\u0026#34;content\u0026#34;][0][\u0026#34;text\u0026#34;] } "},{"uri":"https://tranhoangtrunghieu.github.io/fcj-workshop-template-main/4-eventparticipated/","title":"Events Participated","tags":[],"description":"","content":" ⚠️ Note: The information below is for reference purposes only.

Outside of a workshop environment, you might use this feature to forward DNS queries from your VPC to DNS servers running on-premises. In this section, you will simulate an on-premises conditional forwarder by creating a forwarding rule that forwards DNS queries for Amazon S3 to a Private Hosted Zone running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; in-order to resolve the PrivateLink interface endpoint regional DNS name.\nFrom the Route 53 management console, click Inbound endpoints on the left side bar In the Inbound endpoints console, click the ID of the inbound endpoint Copy the two IP addresses listed to your text editor From the Route 53 menu, choose Resolver \u0026gt; Rules, and click Create rule: In the Create rule console: Name: myS3Rule Rule type: Forward Domain name: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com VPC: VPC On-prem Outbound endpoint: VPCOnpremOutboundEndpoint Target IP Addresses: Enter both IP addresses from your text editor (inbound endpoint addresses) and then click Submit You have successfully created resolver forwarding rule.\nTest the on-premises DNS Simulation Connect to Test-Interface-Endpoint EC2 instance with Session manager Test DNS resolution.

A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint. If you do not attach a policy when you create an endpoint, AWS attaches a default policy for you that allows full access to the service through the endpoint.\nYou can create a policy that restricts access to specific S3 buckets only. This is useful if you only want certain S3 Buckets to be accessible through the endpoint.\nIn this section you will create a VPC endpoint policy that restricts access to the S3 bucket specified in the VPC endpoint policy.\nConnect to an EC2 instance and verify connectivity to S3 Start a new AWS Session Manager session on the instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. From the session, verify that you can list the contents of the bucket you created in Part 1: Access S3 from VPC: aws s3 ls s3://\\\u0026lt;your-bucket-name\\\u0026gt; The bucket contents include the two 1 GB files uploaded in earlier.\nCreate a new S3 bucket; follow the naming pattern you used in Part 1, but add a \u0026lsquo;-2\u0026rsquo; to the name.
