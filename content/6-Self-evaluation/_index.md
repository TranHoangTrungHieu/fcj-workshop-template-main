During my internship at Amazon Web Services (AWS) Vietnam from August 12, 2025 to November 12, 2025, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge gained at university into a real-world working environment.

I participated in the First Cloud Journey (FCJ) project, where I was responsible for:

researching and implementing cloud architectures on AWS,

writing technical proposals and reports,

translating and analyzing AWS technical blogs,

building demo systems using serverless services (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, IAM, etc.),

collaborating with mentors to refine solutions and complete project documentation.

Through these tasks, I significantly improved my skills in programming, system analysis, technical documentation, independent research, task management, and professional communication.

Regarding work ethics, I always strived to complete assigned tasks responsibly, adhered to company regulations, and actively communicated with colleagues and mentors to enhance work efficiency.

Below is my self-evaluation based on key performance criteria:
